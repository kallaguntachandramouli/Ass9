SDLC(sotware Development Life cycle):
SDLC is a process used for developing software applications, encompassing all phases from planning to deployment and maintenance.
It phases:
1.Requirement analysis: plan,define a project scope,Resource planing.
2. Planning: Defining project scope, goals, and deliverables.
3. Requirements Gathering: Collecting and documenting business requirements.
4. Design: Creating a detailed design plan for the software.
5. Implementation: Writing code and developing the software.
6. Testing: Verifying and validating the software.
7. Deployment: Releasing the software to production.
8. Maintenance: Ensuring the software continues to meet user needs.

STLC(Software testing life cycle):
STLC is a subset of SDLC, focusing specifically on the testing phase. 
The process step
1. Requirement:Specification Application architecture document.
2. Test Planning: Defining test objectives, scope, and approach.
3. Test Case Development: Creating test cases and test scripts.
4. Test Environment Setup: Preparing the test environment.
5. Test Execution: Running test cases and reporting defects.
6. Test Cycle Closure: Documenting test results and lessons learned.

 Key differences between SDLC and STLC:

1. Scope:
    - SDLC: Entire software development process
    - STLC: Testing phase of software development
2. Objective:
    - SDLC: Deliver high-quality software product
    - STLC: Ensure software meets quality standards through testing
3. Activities:
    - SDLC: Planning, requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance
    - STLC: Test planning, test case development, test execution, defect reporting, test cycle closure
4. Focus:
    - SDLC: Software development lifecycle
    - STLC: Software testing lifecycle
5. Outcome:
    - SDLC: Developed software product
    - STLC: Tested software product with defects identified and reported

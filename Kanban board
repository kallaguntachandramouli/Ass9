A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage and track work, projects, or tasks.
It's a board with columns representing different stages of work, such as To-Do, In Progress, and Done.

Key Components of a Kanban Board:
1. Columns: Representing different stages of work (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done)
2. Cards: Representing individual tasks or work items
3. Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits: Limiting the number of cards in each column

How Kanban Boards Work:
1. Visualize work: Cards are added to the board to represent tasks.
2. Track progress: Cards move across columns as work progresses.
3. Limit WIP: WIP limits ensure that team members focus on a manageable amount of work.
4. Improve flow: The team works to optimize the flow of work through the board.

Benefits of Kanban Boards:
1. Improved visibility: Work is visible, and progress is tracked.
2. Increased efficiency: WIP limits help teams focus on a manageable amount of work.
3. Better prioritization: Teams can prioritize tasks based on business value and urgency.
4. Enhanced collaboration: Team members can see what others are working on.

Types of Kanban Boards:
1. Physical board: A physical board with sticky notes or cards.
2. Digital board: A digital tool, such as Trello or Asana, with virtual cards and columns.

When to Use Kanban Boards:
1. Software development: Managing tasks and features.
2. Project management: Tracking progress and workflows.
3. Team collaboration: Enhancing communication and visibility.

Agile Model:
Agile is an iterative and incremental software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery. 
It involves breaking down the project into smaller, manageable chunks, and delivering working software in short cycles.
Waterfall Model:
Waterfall is a linear and sequential software development approach that follows a phased approach, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one.
It involves requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

Advantages of Agile over Waterfall Model:
1. Flexibility: Agile allows for changes in requirements and priorities, whereas Waterfall assumes that requirements are fixed.
2. Iterative Development: Agile delivers working software in short cycles, allowing for early feedback and adaptation.
3. Collaboration: Agile emphasizes team collaboration, customer involvement, and continuous communication.
4. Risk Management: Agile identifies and addresses risks early, reducing the likelihood of project failure.
5. Faster Time-to-Market: Agile's iterative approach enables faster delivery of working software.
6. Improved Quality: Agile's focus on continuous testing and feedback ensures higher quality software.
7. Customer Satisfaction: Agile's iterative approach and customer involvement ensure that the final product meets customer needs.
